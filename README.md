## Summary

Looking at the data, the results indicate there is a positive bias toward Vine reviews as 54% of 5 star reviews were through Amazon Vine, compared to 46% of 5 star reviews being non-Vine. 

One additional analysis that could be done with the dataset is to analyze it's measures of central tendency such as mean, median, and mode. In addition, understanding the datasets distribution will allow us to further understand if the data we are using is fit for making conclusions. From there we can do hypothesis testing and statisically prove if there is a positive bias or not toward Vine reviews.
